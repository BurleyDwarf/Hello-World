# Hello-World

The introduction to Github.

My name is Jimi. My first bit (excuse the pun) of coding was done on a TI-994/a, back around 1983. between now and then I haven't done a lot of coding, but it has allways been interesting to me. Until recently I have not pounced upon the opportunities to learn more coding. Busy with life. Life aside, as my children have grown, I have more time to pursue these matters. I've only dabbled, and I really have no particular goals in mind, but to enjoy the experience I had as an 8 year old boy playing with one of the first home computers, and creating dynamic worlds/ universes.
